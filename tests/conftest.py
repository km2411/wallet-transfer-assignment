"""Shared fixtures for the repository/integration and end-to-end tiers (ADR-0006): one
session-scoped Postgres testcontainers instance with Flyway migrations applied once, not a
fresh container per test — CT1-CT7 each already run multiple concurrent operations, and
starting a container per test would be too slow to sustain that.

Flyway runs as its own container (the same official flyway/flyway image `just migrate` uses,
not a different mechanism) attached to a shared Docker network alongside the Postgres
testcontainer, reachable by network alias — this is "the same migrations applied the same way"
ADR-0004 asks for, not a from-scratch schema-creation path that could drift from it."""
